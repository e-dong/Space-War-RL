At work I learned the power of automation and how it saves valuable developer time. Since I'm starting to do deployments to itch.io, I can apply the same principle. I've only used gitlab ci, so this will be my first time using github actions. Other than syntax differences, the main difference is the paradigm to accomplish similar things.

## Setup

I can do this automatically from this [github action extension](https://github.com/KikimoraGames/itch-publish). It leverages [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) to automatically upload files to itch.io.
