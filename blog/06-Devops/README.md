At work I learned the power of automation and how it saves valuable developer time. Since I'm starting to do deployments to itch.io, I can apply the same principle. I've only used gitlab ci, so this will be my first time using github actions.

I can do this automatically from this [github action extension](https://github.com/KikimoraGames/itch-publish). It leverages [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) to automatically upload files to itch.io.
