# Space War RL

I will be remaking the 1985 version of Space War using Pygame and train deep reinforcement learning agents to battle it out. I will try to do everything from scratch as much as possible as a learning exercise!

## First Time Setup

Create a virtualenv with `python -m venv venv`. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Starting the game

python -m game

## Development

Install additonal dev dependencies with:
`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
